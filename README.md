# Speech-Driven Animation

This library implements the end-to-end facial synthesis model described in this [paper](https://sites.google.com/view/facialsynthesis/home).


## Installing

To install the library do:
```
$ pip install .
```

## Running the example

To create the animations you will need to instantiate the VideoAnimator class. Then you provide an image and audio clip (or the paths to the files) and a video will be produced.
